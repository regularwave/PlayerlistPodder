# PlayerlistPodder

Be on the event registration page (the one that shows the "Registered Players" and "Companion App Lobby" sections).

Register players into the event.

Once all players are showing up in the Registered Players section, click the extension icon.

*Report text*: allows you to customize the heading at the top of the pod report.

*Non-4 pref*: For example: if you have 10 players, would you prefer one pod of four and two pods of three, or two pods of five?

*Seats*: how many physical seats are available?

*Show overrides*: Have a cEDH or new-players group that wants to be podded together? Clicking this button will add a column to the Registered Players section that allows you to specify a pod number for specific players. If possible, those players will be podded together.

*Generate pods*: This will open a new tab with the player pods.

Small indie companies don't have the resources to add features to their event creation systems.
